The goal of the study is to study NOx relationship with other gases in polluted areas and predict NOx concentration level, as NOx is highly linked to air quality, as discussed by study 1, where descending to a certain critical breakpoint in NOx concentration results in the decline in "formation of secondary aerosol." Another purpose is to attempt to see if NOx concentration levels can be predicted purely through sensors, temperature, and humidity level.
